# Project: Campus Hub

## Overview
In this second phase of the Campus Hub project, you will implement JavaScript functionality for your assigned module. Building on the HTML and CSS foundations from Phase 1, you will now add dynamic behavior and data integration to make your module fully interactive.

## Phase Two Deadline
* **Due Date**: Saturday 26/04/2025 Midnight

## Your Task
You will implement all JavaScript functionality for your assigned module, including event handling, form validation, data fetching, and dynamic content rendering. Your module should now be fully interactive and populated with data.

## Module Assignments
Continue working on your previously assigned module:
1. Events Calendar
2. Study Group Finder
3. Course Reviews
4. Course Notes
5. Campus News
6. Club Activities
7. Student Marketplace

## Technical Requirements

### For ALL Modules
Each module must implement the following JavaScript functionality:

1. **Data Integration**
   * Use the Fetch API to retrieve data from a JSON source
   * Implement proper error handling for failed requests
   * Display loading states during data fetching
   * You may use dummy data hosted on GitHub or any mock API service such as:
     - [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) - Free fake API for testing
     - [MockAPI](https://mockapi.io/) - Tool to mock REST APIs

2. **Interactive Features**
   * Implement search functionality with filters
   * Add sorting capabilities for listed items
   * Create working pagination
   * Implement form validation without submitting the form

3. **Dynamic Content**
   * Render list items dynamically from fetched data
   * Implement detail view population when an item is selected

4. **User Experience Enhancements**
   * Add appropriate loading indicators
   * Implement form validation with helpful error messages

## Technical Specifications

* Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) features
* Implement proper error handling throughout your code
* Structure your code using functions or classes for organization
* Add appropriate comments to explain complex logic
* Ensure all user inputs are properly validated

## Collaboration Requirements
1. All code must be pushed to the team GitHub repository in your assigned branch
2. Create your feature branch (format: `phase2-[module-name]`)
3. Submit the repository link and a link to GitHub pages to the instructor for review
