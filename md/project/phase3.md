# Project: Campus Hub

## Overview
In this third phase of the Campus Hub project, you will implement a PHP backend API to support your JavaScript frontend from Phase 2. This will transform your application into a full-stack solution with proper data persistence and retrieval capabilities.

## Phase Three Deadline
* **Due Date**: Friday 10/05/2025 Midnight

## Your Task
You will create a RESTful API using PHP that connects to a MySQL/MariaDB database. This API will serve as the backend for your assigned module, handling data storage, retrieval, and processing.

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Development
1. **PHP API Implementation**
   * Create a RESTful API with appropriate endpoints for your module
   * Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   * Use PDO for database connections and queries
   * Structure your code following proper MVC or similar architectural patterns
   * Implement proper error handling and status codes

2. **Database Integration**
   * Use MySQL or MariaDB as your database system
   * Design an appropriate database schema for your module
   * Implement proper relationships between tables if needed
   * Use prepared statements for all database queries to prevent SQL injection

3. **API Endpoints**
   * Implement endpoints for listing, filtering, and searching data
   * Create endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting records
   * Add pagination support for list endpoints
   * Document all API endpoints with clear descriptions of parameters and responses

4. **Security Considerations**
   * Implement basic input validation and sanitization
   * Note: Detailed authentication and security requirements will be discussed next week

## Hosting Requirements
1. **Backend Hosting**
   * Host your PHP backend on Replit
   * Ensure your API is accessible from your frontend
   * Configure your database connection properly

2. **Version Control**
   * Push all code to your team's GitHub repository
   * Create a new branch for Phase 3 (format: `phase3-[module-name]`)
   * Include clear documentation on how to set up and run your backend

## Submission Requirements
1. Submit the GitHub repository link containing your code
2. Provide the Replit link where your backend is hosted
3. Include a brief documentation explaining:
   * API endpoints and their functionality
   * Database schema design
   * Setup instructions

## Note
The details regarding authentication and additional security measures will be discussed in the next class. For now, focus on implementing the core API functionality and database integration.
